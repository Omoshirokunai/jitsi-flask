# Simple Jitsi-flask

Experiment with the jitsi meet api in a flask app.

## How to run

`git clone git@github.com:Omoshirokunai/jitsi-flask.git`

like any flask app:

`flask run`

visit the jitsi api docs: <https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/dev-guide/dev-guide-iframe>

for jitsi-meet config settings see: <https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/blob/master/interface_config.js>

ps: *(theres probably not that many reasons why anyone would run a personal jitsi app this way but hey it can be done so why not)*
